# Influence maximization with independent cascade

This repository is for the first programming exercise in Networks Design and Analysis summer term 2018 at the technical university of vienna.

## Build

To build the code and run with default values simply execute the following:

```shell
./gradlew clean jar
cd build/libs/
java -jar independent_cascade_model_implementation.jar
```

The following options are available and can be displayed when adding the -h flag to the jar execution. 

```shell
usage: java -jar <name> [-b <arg>] [-h] [-i] [-p <arg>] [-s <arg>] [-v]
 -b,--budget <arg>        how many seed nodes should be chosen value > 0
 -h,--help                print this message
 -i,--indegree            use the in-degree activation function instead of
                          the uniform probability
 -p,--probability <arg>   the uniform probability, value between 1 and 100
 -s,--scenarios <arg>     how many scenarios should be created value > 0
 -v,--visualize           visualization of the output
```

## Implementation

There are in total three implementations:
* GreedyApproximation Algorithm - based on the lecture slides with multiple scenario runs - very time consuming
* Single Diffusion - heavily based on the activation function also takes nodes greedily
* Independent Cascade Model - based on the paper from Goyal et al. from 2011  where they presented the CELF++ algorithm.

## Test Instance

The code got implemented with directed graphs in mind and uses the Cit-HepPh.txt data set from [standford.](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)

It is also possible to use this program with other directed graphs, we did not implement the undirected version. This is easily possible by adapting the ProblemGraph and the ProblemReader to make edges bidirectional.

## Visualization

There is a very basic visualization implemented with the GraphStream API. It only shows seed nodes and activated nodes, as well as one layer of neighbours (inactive) and maximum four per node. This may result in not completely connected results in the visualization.
